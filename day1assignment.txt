5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?
ans:Through distributed database ,we can attain verfiability.Distributed database means copy of data is with several people.So if data of any block changes ,the hash key of that block and remaining blocks changes.This change in hashkey can be verified from the near by people who had the copy of data and there by we can recover the data from them.
